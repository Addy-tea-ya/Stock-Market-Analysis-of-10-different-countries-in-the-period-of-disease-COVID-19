We have endowed the nations with their respective stock markets stated in brackets - Brazil(Ibovespa), Canada (S&P/TSX Composite), France (AEX), Germany (DAX 30), India (NIFTY 50), Italy (FTSE MIB), Russia (IMOEX), Spain (IBEX 35), U.K. (FTSE 100), U.S.A. (DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE). We have gathered the indices of stock per country from 2 March to 23rd June, collected from official website of respective stocks. In order to collect data, we had to inculcate the fundamental lessons of Statistics. R-software aided us to plot the curves of stock values providing an ease to master our project. We also formulated a Python 3.7 language program code to solidify analysis on various aspects of economy of the countries and comparison between these aspects.
